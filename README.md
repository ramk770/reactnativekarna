## Problem statement 
In response to the pressing issue of food waste and the simultaneous challenge of ensuring access to nutritious meals for those in need, this project introduces a Waste Food Collection and Delivery App
This innovative solution leverages mobile technology to connect food donors with surplus edibles to recipients in need.
The app streamlines the process of collecting excess food from various sources and orchestrates efficient deliveries to organizations or individuals requiring assistance. 
Through this initiative, we aim to bridge the gap between surplus food and hunger, contributing to a more sustainable and socially responsible food distribution ecosystem.

## About the project
Our innovative food waste management system, available as an Android application, offers a solution. 
Designed to connect restaurants and hotels with leftover food to NGOs dedicated to combating hunger, this food donation app ensures that excess food finds its way to those in need rather than ending up in landfills.
 NGO Requests: NGOs can raise a request for excess food through the app.
Restaurant Approval: Participating restaurants receive these requests and can approve them based on their leftover food availability.
Food Collection: Once approved, NGOs can collect the food for distribution among the needy
Racking and History: The system maintains a record of all transactions, allowing for transparency and accountability.

## Declaration
A waste food collection and delivery app can play a crucial role in addressing both food wastage and the needs of underprivileged individuals. 
By connecting surplus food from restaurants, events, or households with those who are in need, the app promotes sustainability and social responsibility.
This initiative not only reduces food waste but also contributes to alleviating hunger and fostering a sense of community by channeling resources to where they are most needed. 
Overall, such an app has the potential to make a positive impact on both the environment and society.
